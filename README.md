# threeASC
An ASCII file explorer to visualize terrain Digital Elevation Models (DEM) easily with ThreeJS.

Just load an ASC terrain file and a satellite image. You can use the files in **"dem"** and **"img"** folders.

It works by reading every value in the ASCII file and passing them to the vertices of a 3D mesh.

You can also toggle elevation display (disabled at start for performance)
