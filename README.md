# threeASC
An ASCII file explorer conceived to visualize terrain Digital Elevation Models (DEM) easily with ThreeJS.

Just load an ASC terrain file and a satellite image. You can use the files in **"dem"** and **"img"** folders.

You can also toggle elevation display (disabled at start for performance)

**WIP Demo**
